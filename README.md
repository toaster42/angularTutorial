**Current Step:** 
[Lesson 11](https://angular.io/tutorial/first-app/first-app-lesson-11) Integrate details page

At the end of this lesson your application will have support for routing to the details page.

Each housing location has specific details that should be displayed when a user navigates to the details page for that item. To accomplish this goal, you will need to use route parameters.

Route parameters enable you to include dynamic information as a part of your route URL. To identify which housing location a user has clicked on you will use the id property of the HousingLocation type.



**Past Step(s):** 
[Lesson 10](https://angular.io/tutorial/first-app/first-app-lesson-10) Routing in Angular

Routing is the ability to navigate from one component in the application to another. In Single Page Applications (SPA), only parts of the page are updated to represent the requested view for the user.

The Angular Router enables users to declare routes and specify which component should be displayed on the screen if that route is requested by the application.

In this lesson, we will enable routing in the application to navigate to the details page.
